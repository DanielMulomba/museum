      <h3 class="name">Dr. Amara Velin</h3>
      <p class="bio">Dr. Amara Velin (PhD, University of Edinburgh) specializes in underground temples and tunnel sanctuaries. She uses drone GPR and 3D photogrammetry to reveal lost urban networks. Dr. Amara Velin holds a PhD in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh, where she studied under Dr. Fiona Hartwell, a leading expert in ancient subterranean architecture. Known for her precision and calm leadership, she has led excavations across the Mediterranean basin, unearthing forgotten tunnel sanctuaries once used for ritual navigation. Using drone-based ground-penetrating radar and photogrammetry, she reconstructs underground temple systems in 3D for public exhibitions. At the Museum of Cultural Memory, she curates the Hidden Cities exhibit, connecting ancient pathways with modern urban planning.
Special Consideration: Recipient of the 2024 UNESCO Field Innovation Award for her work on sustainable excavation.</p>

      <h3 class="name">Dr. Tariq N'Golo</h3>
      <p class="bio">Dr. Tariq N’Golo earned his doctorate in Biological Anthropology from the University of Cape Town. His research focuses on the skeletal markers of cultural identity and ritual sacrifice in early trans-Saharan civilizations. Combining osteological analysis with genetic sequencing, he reconstructs migration stories written in bones. At the Museum, Tariq oversees the Echoes of Flesh and Stone collection, cataloguing skeletal remains with compassion and reverence. A patient and meticulous field scientist, he advocates for ethical collaboration with descendant communities.
Special Consideration: Tariq is fluent in six African dialects and integrates oral storytelling traditions into his academic research.</p>

      <p class="bio">Dr. Elara Mohn is a Cultural Semiotician specializing in comparative mythology and visual linguistics. She earned her PhD at the Sorbonne, studying the evolution of sacred symbols from Neolithic carvings to modern art. Her work bridges anthropology and philosophy, decoding the symbolic language of forgotten societies. At the Museum of Cultural Memory, she leads the Voices of Meaning interpretive lab, transforming unearthed artifacts into immersive digital storytelling experiences. Elara’s analytical yet poetic style often challenges the museum’s field researchers, as she insists that “truth lies not in the object, but in its interpretation.”
Special Consideration: Dr. Mohn is a published poet and occasionally curates cross-cultural art performances linking myth and modern identity.</p>
